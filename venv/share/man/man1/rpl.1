.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rpl
[-h] [--version] [--encoding ENCODING] [-i] [-m] [-w] [-b] [-q] [-v] [-s] [-e] [-F] [--files] [-x GLOB] [-R] [-p] [-f] [-d] OLD-TEXT NEW-TEXT [FILE ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Search and replace text in files.
Text matching the pattern \fIOLD-TEXT\fR is replaced by \fINEW-TEXT\fR in each \fIFILE\fR. The pattern may match multiple lines.

Filenames may include glob patterns (these must be quoted to
avoid being interpreted by the shell), and in particular may use ‘\fI**\fR’ to
match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. Tilde and
environment variable expansion is also performed.
